CiviCRM Log Viewer

This is a naive, simple log viewer for the CiviCRM admin log that normally goes in files/civicrm/ConfigAndLog/

It shows a summary of the current log file, in reverse chronological order, with links to detailed view of each log entry.

It makes no attempt to display anything in a pretty way, and it might break in other languages and/or non-default time/date formats.
